# Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Dialogue Generation and Q/A

## Overview
This project pioneers a sophisticated hybrid and novel transformer architecture that merges the sequential data processing prowess of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with the transformer model's ability to manage long-range dependencies efficiently. This architecture is specifically tailored to revolutionize natural language processing (NLP) tasks by enhancing context comprehension and accelerating training processes. The innovation lies in its unique design, which addresses the conventional limitations of RNNs and transformers, offering a versatile solution for complex NLP challenges.

## Motivation
Despite the advancements in natural language processing, in the form of transformers, we wanted to build a transformer architecture that predicts the next character by accumulating the information collected by all the heads in the attention mechanism. This project aims to evaluate the performance of this hybrid model against state-of-the-art baselines, using both automated and human evaluations.

## Hybrid Architecture
The hybrid architecture is meticulously crafted, featuring a dual-layered approach that integrates RNNs for detailed sequential analysis and transformers for their parallel processing capabilities. This combination allows for an unprecedented level of understanding of contextual nuances within text data. The architecture optimizes the transformer model by incorporating RNNs to refine its attention mechanism, ensuring a more precise interpretation of word relationships and sentence structures. The design significantly reduces the computational complexity typically associated with transformers, making it more accessible for real-world applications.

These sections are further elaborated with technical details, implementation strategies, and comparative analyses in the full report, providing a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope and its contribution to advancing NLP methodologies.


## Datasets
We evaluated our model on three datasets to cover a broad spectrum of dialogue and question-answering scenarios:
1. **Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus**: Dialogues from movie scripts.
2. **Ask Reddit QA**: Question and answering pairs from Reddit.
3. **Stanford QA (SQuAD)**: Reading comprehension and question-answering based on Wikipedia articles.

## Experiments and Results
Our experiments demonstrate the hybrid model's effectiveness across different datasets, showing improvements in BLEU, Rouge, and perplexity metrics compared to baseline models.

## Future Work
We propose further enhancements, including experimenting with cross-attention mechanisms and exploring reinforcement learning techniques for model training optimization.
